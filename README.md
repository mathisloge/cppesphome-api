# cppesphomeapi

cppesphomeapi allows you to interact with devices flashed with [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/)

The API interfaces are modelled after [aioesphomeapi](https://github.com/esphome/aioesphomeapi).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is currently heavy work in progress and far from feature complete or stable.
> I would recommend to not use it currently.
